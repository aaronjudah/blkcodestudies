==================================

Stop & Write
----------------

Twitter repeatedly makes use of suggested follows. Most times these suggested accounts are as directly related to the current account as possible, which allows for surface level connections. However, the “suggested” system does not funnel into less mainstream viewpoints to be recognized or highlight the current account’s content in relation to other users. Also shows accounts that are mutually followed between myself and the person whose account I’m viewing. Interesting but not very useful when looking at a certified account. Like, so what if Killer Mike and I both follow Anderson Paak.? Maybe all of this improves as one follows more people, then suggested accounts become more obscure and it’s more interesting to see who mutually follows which obscure accounts.

Final Report
------------

In class we have mentioned more than once, President Donald Trump’s blunder in addressing the contributions of Frederick Douglass to Black History (or Present?). My twitter list @freddieglass, a play on Frederick Douglass and Freddie Gray, imagines the opinions that a modern day Douglass would curate in his own Twitter feed. Accounts were selected as they related to Douglass’ values, locations traveled, political contemporaries, and institutions followed.

Deray McKesson ([@deray](https://twitter.com/deray)) speaks to Baltimore at the local level, systemic racism at the national level, and the ignition of the Black Lives Matter movement on international platforms. Deray, much like Douglass, is often a speaker for the Black Lives Matter movement due to the strength of his convictions, his experiential perspective, and eloquence.

Ta-Nehisi Coates ([@tanehisicoates](https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates)) largely fulfills the same role as Deray, but bridges the gap into formal publication through his works as a journalist and author, akin to Douglass’ role as editor of The North Star. It is also of note that Coates has shared his perspectives living in both Baltimore and New York, as Douglass had.
Jacobin Magazine ([@jacobinmag](https://twitter.com/jacobinmag)) reflects the type of publications and voices of the American left that echo the mission of The North Star.

A modern-day Douglass would be an unabashed supporter of the feminist movement. Douglass’ interest in liberty expanded beyond the United States as well. Malala Fund ([@MalalaFund](https://twitter.com/MalalaFund)) highlights Douglass’ bold support for the burgeoning feminist movement and his unrelenting global perspective.

Rapper Killer Mike ([@KillerMike](https://twitter.com/KillerMike)) was the answer to the modern John Brown. While I don’t believe Killer Mike to be radical enough to stage a Harper’s Ferry-esque incident, his abrasive lyrics three increasingly politicized RTJ albums (song titles include “A Report to the Shareholders / Kill Your Masters” and “Don’t Get Captured”) lead me to believe that Killer Mike’s vision of change operates slightly more on the fringe than Douglass’ might have. Despite his polarizing lyrics, the logic and succinctness of his arguments, especially in interviews, would be an interesting perspective for Douglass to wrestle with.

I have found that Twitter works like an RSS version of Tumblr. While this sounds boring, it is actually helpful to understand the purpose of the platform. Twitter, unlike Tumblr, exists in realtime, adding a gravity and propulsion to the conversations that happen. On Tumblr, tags, reposts, and likes have little relevance in time and leave individuals blogs to float freely without discovery or disruption. Twitter is constantly feeding the next moment to you and awaiting output. 

For me, [BlackPeopleTwitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/) raises similar concerns found in the Tillet reading. That snapshots of black culture found on Twitter assert a singular black narrative to onlookers **which are then interpreted as the whole of the black experience** is dangerous. The ability to travel freely in and out of this realm of blackness, facilitated by Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc. undermines a holistic view of black people. While the tweeters are simply producing content that is relevant for them, there is assuredly a cohort of black twitter users who want a “tasteful” BlackPeopleTwitter.
