# Twitter Module: Twitter Chat
## Topic
Black Lives Matter is not a moment, but a movement. The movement has been pivotal in bringing attention to a society still rife with racism and oppression, and has become a platform for Black people to speak out against it. BLM has created a huge network nationwide, but where is this massive organization heading? And in today’s retrogressive political climate, how can BLM push for action to infix justice and equality in our system while also keeping female, differently abled, LGBTQ+ identifying, non-binary, trans, etc. people at the forefront of the movement? We are gathering faces and leaders of the BLM movement to discuss BLM’s plans going forward and how chapters around the country are working together.

**Hashtag for chat**: #BLMMarchingOn

**Participants**: Deray McKesson, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi + open to any and all asking questions
## Questions
### To Deray McKesson
1. You said in an interview with NBC following the protest in Baton Rouge "We should not have to protest. We should not be in the streets.” But when tweeting #BlackLivesMatter and inspiring peaceful protests fail to inspire the large scale racial-blind change and progress desired, does protest exist as the only feasible way to capture attention and concern? 
2. How do you perceive the riots in Baltimore in context of the larger #BlackLivesMatter movement? How has the movement evolved from the violent riots in April 2015?
3. What has proven more effective: riots, marches, or social media movements?
4. How do you view the ways that #BlackLivesMatter has been changed to fit other marginalized groups, like #TransLivesMatter or #MuslimLivesMatter?
### To Alicia Garza
1. When you first used the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin, did you have any idea that it would inspire a global movement for Black lives?
2. How important is Twitter and social media as an instant, global web of individuals for these kinds of movements in your opinion? 
3. In an interview with Moyers and Company in October 2016, you described the movement of BLM as a “demand to end the war on black people.” Do you perceive technology, social media platforms, and gadgets that allow us to share our thoughts publically as our weapons? Are we well equipped for this war? 
4. When organizations want to use the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, would you like for them to contact you to ask for permission?
5. In what situations would you NOT grant permission to use the hashtag?

### To Opal Tometi
1. How do you contextualize BLM among other civil rights movements? How would Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr, Coretta Scott King, and Rosa Parks appreciate this movement in the steps towards equal rights for all races?
2. If these heroes had access to twitter and other social media platforms, how do you imagine they would have used them? 
3. You are involved with Black Alliance for Just Immigration. Can you explain the link between black justice and immigration movements?
4. What are your thoughts on linking movements for women’s rights, gay rights, ethnic equality rights, equal pay rights, etc. Does lumping together movements inspire large-scale change, or instead lose power by trying to address many issues at once? 
5. How do you respond to people saying that Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave to see the violence that is occurring during protests and rallies? How has this bastardization of MLK’s message affected the way that people think about protests?
### For all participants:
1. What kind of role has Black Surveillance played in your life?
2. How do you perceive your role in the larger Black Machines, the people behind Black movements on social media? 
3. What role does technology play in your life-- in sharing your message for anyone who wants to access it? 
4. If you were the activist that you are in a time without technology, through what platforms would you share your abolitionist, anti-white supremacy thoughts? 
5. Do you think that social media has made Black surveillance easier, or is it beneficial that it has it made access to the information more accessible for everyone?
